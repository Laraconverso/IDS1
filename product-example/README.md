## Docker

Docker is an abstraction layer that allows applications to run in a loosely isolated context called a container

Install docker and docker-compose following the instructions in https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Review the environment variables in .env and start the system:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
